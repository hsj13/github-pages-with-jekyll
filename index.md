# Welcome to my blog

I'm glad you are here. I plan to talk about Jagdish Dekhmukh. He is a person of good nature. He is a boy. He likes eating snacks because he always eats them. He is cute. I like him. I want him to be with me always as a friend. He is a nice person. His counter arguments are beautiful. he likes clapping on meme of BLM. He likes frogs. He sometimes appreciates me and I like that. Stay safe buddy bro. Buddy bro is his nickname. He likes doing important stuff late. For example, he has been delaying LOTR from a long long time and I will kill him for that. We have watched one series together - Game of Thrones. Earlier, he liked Harshit more but after DEP-C, I am his best friend (atleast what I assume). 
He laughs on my jokes.
Love you buddy bro.
